Vint Brown GB

Hey!

By the end of Q1 2021, Me (Rui) and Asryl would be running a Vint Brown GB

First of all, a little intro to these switches. Since switches are really heavily dependent on one's preference, I can't say whether it's good or bad, but rather whether I personally like it or not.

For me, what I personally like about it is the smoothness of it, but of course, not all batches are perfect

Hence, inspired by the Vint Black GB ran by @qiuku, I have used the same three tables to categororised the switches: Cleaness, Smoothness, and Both

Cleaness Table:
|Cleaness Rating|                                 |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------|
|New            |From a brand new board           |
|Clean          |Some dust, easily cleaned        |
|Dirty          |Needs a brush, maaaybe ultrasonic|

Smoothness Table:
|Smoothness|                                                            |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
|Smooth    |Very smooth, feeling similar to modern switches             |
|Mediocre  |Very similar to smooth, but definitely can tell a difference|
|Rough     |Scratch, needs lube to break in                             |

With these two tables, I have following ratings for the switches:
|Ratings   |     |     |     |
|:---------|:----|:----|:----|
|          |New  |Clean|Dirty|
|Smooth    |A0   |A1   |A2   |
|Mediocre  |B0   |B1   |B2   |
|Rough     |C0   |C1   |C2   |


Lastly, for the inventory and price
Inventory is unconfirmed as we are still waiting for the boards to arrive, and the prices are subject to change as well

|Rating|Qty    |Price** |
|:-----|:-----:|:-------|
|A0    |-      |100     |
|A1    |-      |95      |
|A2    |-      |90      |
|B0    |-      |85      |
|B1    |-      |80      |
|B2    |-      |75      |
|C0    |-      |70      |
|C1    |-      |85      |
|C2    |-      |80      |

_**Take note that all prices include qexpress shipping, and might change based on quality._
